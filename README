This library is meant to support developers doing Link-based Resource
Descriptor Discovery (LRDD) and working with Extensible Service Descriptors
(XRD).


## LRDD ##

The Link-based Resource Descriptor Discovery protocol (pronounced 'lard') is a
collection of three link methods and a common relation type ('lrdd').
Together they are used to associate a descriptor to the resource it describes.

The LRDD portion of this library is only responsible for retrieving the Links
for a resource, using the various discovery methods.


## XRD ##

The Extensible Resource Descriptor is a simple XML-based schema for describing
resources. The schema has a two-sections architecture where one describes the
resource itself and the other describes its relationships to other resources.
For example, the self describing section can include information such as which
API version the endpoint supports, while the relationships section can indicate
where to fine the address book of the person associated with the resource.
